# WSQ07_Lists
Create a program that asks the user for 10 numbers  (floating point). Store those numbers in a list. Show to the user the total, average and standard deviation of those numbers.  Details For Python3 you want to be using Lists here.  Once you have this working, change it so that users keep giving you values until they signal “no more values”. How would you implement this?
